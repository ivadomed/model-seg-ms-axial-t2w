# Automated Segmentation of the Spinal Cord and Hyperintense Lesions in Acute Spinal Cord Injury

This repository contains the code for deep learning-based segmentation of the spinal cord and T2-weighted hyperintense lesions in acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The code is based on the well-known [nnUNet framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).
